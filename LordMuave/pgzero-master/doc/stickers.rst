`Sticker Mule`_ have graciously offered to provide a number of stickers for
Pygame Zero users for free.

Laptop stickers are a great way to encourage students to continue tinkering and
learning, as well as spreading the word about Pygame Zero.

The stickers should look a little like this (not to scale):

For learners
------------

Due to the costs of distribution, and because Pygame Zero is a free community
library, **we don't have a way of getting stickers directly to you yet.**

It may be possible to obtain stickers at conferences and meet-ups. Please
check back soon.


For educators/meet-ups
----------------------

We would like to distribute stickers primarily via educators and educational
meet-ups. At this time it is not known how many stickers we will be able to
distribute in this way (and it may be prohibitively expensive to ship them
outside the UK).

Please fill out our `Google Form`_ to express your interest.

For developers
--------------

Free stickers are primarily intended for learners. However, if a pull request
you make to Pygame Zero or a translation is accepted, we would be very happy to
give you a free laptop sticker if the opportunity arises.

Please request a sticker in your Pull Request comments (or make yourself known
at a conference/meet-up).

If you attend educational events or Python events regularly, and you would be
willing to distribute stickers, this could also be useful. Please let us know.
